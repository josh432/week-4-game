## Crystal Collector
Crystal Collector is an entertaining number and memory game where the player tries to use magical crystals to match a random number picked by the computer. I had a really fun time coding this and it is a blast to play. Built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and JQuery.

Have fun, and listen to Phil! https://josh432.github.io/week-4-game/index.html
